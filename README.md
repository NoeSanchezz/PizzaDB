Pizza Database 
Project Overview:
This personal project focuses on developing a comprehensive data management system for a delivery/pickup pizza restaurant. As a skilled Data Analyst, I created a relational database to store and organize crucial restaurant data, performed data normalization to ensure data integrity, and crafted custom PostgreSQL queries, including left join, temporary tables, and views. Additionally, I designed two interactive dashboards to monitor restaurant orders and efficiently manage inventory.

Key Features:

Relational Database: The database architecture allows for efficient storage and retrieval of essential information, including customer details, order history, inventory records, pricing, and delivery logistics.

Data Normalization: By applying industry-standard data normalization techniques, I eliminated data redundancies and ensured data consistency, leading to a streamlined and optimized data structure.

Custom PostgreSQL Queries: Advanced SQL queries were designed to extract valuable insights from the database. These queries offer comprehensive analysis of order trends, customer behavior, and effective inventory management.

Interactive Dashboards: The project includes two dynamic dashboards. The first dashboard provides real-time order metrics, such as order frequency, average order value, and peak hours. The second dashboard offers real-time inventory updates, ingredient usage tracking, and reordering suggestions for efficient inventory control.
How to Use:

Database Setup: Execute the SQL script provided to create the relational database. Adjust the database connection parameters to match your PostgreSQL setup.

Data Import: Import your pizza restaurant's data into the newly created database. Ensure data consistency and accuracy during the import process.

Run Custom Queries: Utilize the custom PostgreSQL queries to gain valuable insights into order patterns, customer preferences, and inventory status. Modify or create new queries as per your specific analytical requirements.

Dashboard Access: To access the interactive dashboards, set up a web server (e.g., Apache) and deploy the dashboard files. Update the database connection details in the dashboard configuration file.

Dashboard Usage: The dashboards offer an intuitive user interface to monitor order trends and inventory levels in real-time. Leverage the insights to make data-driven decisions for optimizing business operations.

Future Enhancements:

Implement predictive analytics for demand forecasting to facilitate proactive inventory management.
Explore AI-driven recommendations for personalized order suggestions, enhancing customer experiences.
Integrate customer feedback analysis to gain insights into customer satisfaction and preferences.
